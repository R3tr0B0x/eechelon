Introduction
<br><br>
Our country is quite infamous for its overwhelming population density. Rather than focusing on the issue which is already overwhelming, it can be utilized by looking at it from an optimistic point of view. We have come up with an idea similar to carpooling in the sense that people will be a delivery medium without being tied to any organization or company, much like work at free will if two people cooperates.

<br><br><br>
Who are we?
<br><br>
We are a group of three individuals and we fall on the frustrated spectrum of Dhaka due its nagging traffic jams, weather and the hostile conditions of the roads of our beloved city. We aspire to solve some of these problems, however little it may be with an app which we hope would have a positive impact on everyday life.
We represent the company eechelon (the meaning of the word) being “assignment” or “distribution” much like the motto of our app to assign someone a job that they could easily do and distribute the workload.

Problem Statement
<br><br>
Let’s assume that A and B are two locations within the densely populated mainstream cities and that a person living in location B and needs to retrieve a package from location A. To carry out this task, the person is required to make two trips, first from B to A, which prepares the person to carry out the actual task, i.e. to bring the package back to B from A. The first trip, from B to A consumes effort but has no yield, as it has no outcome, it only makes the person eligible to carry out the real work on the next trip. 
<br><br>
This extra meaningless effort not only wastes time and energy, it also increases physical traffic which is another issue. However, due to the nature and quantity of our population, at any given time, the probability of a random person moving from a location, A to another location, B is quite decent. It would be very convenient for this person to cooperate as he has to make the trip from A to B anyway. In such a scenario, people would only be making optimal number of trips, getting rid of unnecessary trips, reducing traffic, effort and saving time in the process. Such a form of cooperation is what eechelon.com is based on. 
<br><br>
This is where we come in and utilize current technology, mainly the web and a mobile device to ease some of these hassles of everyday life. The app will be called eechelon and we hope that it would catch on with the users quickly. And that the meaning is simply to be coordinated, and hence the project’s name: Coordinated Delivery System or CDS for short.
